Prior to academia, she spent over 15 years in the industry, leading complex information technology enabled strategic change projects and programmes, and providing consultancy services. Dicle’s interdisciplinary research focuses on projects as temporary organisations, and seeks to link this to questions about leadership, strategy and value creation. Her PhD research brought together studies of projects and leadership to outline the complexities inherent in projects that make leadership particularly difficult, and offered an alternative model of project leadership. During her PhD, she became a Research Fellow on the ESRC funded Project X initiative, a collaboration between government, academia and industry that aims to generate unique insights into the performance of major projects and programmes. In this role she researched the leadership challenges encountered in sustainability transitions projects that face radical uncertainty.

Multicomponent materials such as polymer gels and interstitial solid solutions have in common the nature of their constituents: they are composed of a  host solid of fixed composition and guest species that can move through the interstitial space of the host constituent. Such a  material has a definite shape inherited from the host component and variable composition since the number of guest species can change. Hence, modeling the behavior of this type of solid body requires a proper treatment of mechanical and chemical phenomena brought about by changes in shape and composition, a task that can become still more complicated in the presence of phase transformations.
